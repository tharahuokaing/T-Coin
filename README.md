             T-COIN (THARA COIN) - SECURE LEDGER SYSTEM v2.0
========================================================================

1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW
-------------------
T-Coin (Thara Coin) is a high-speed, centralized digital ledger designed 
for the Thara ecosystem (Casino, Bank, and AI services). It utilizes 
a "Two-Man Integrity" (TMI) security protocol and a 30-day "Dead Man's 
Switch" (DMS) to ensure that large-scale transactions and system 
overrides are never performed by a single individual or without 
active oversight.

2. CORE FEATURES
----------------
- Ultra-Fast Ledger: In-memory JavaScript Map architecture.
- Two-Man Integrity: Requires synchronized approval from Officer 1 
  (dutyfree) and Officer 2 (dutyfree1).
- Dead Man's Switch: Automated system lockdown if no security pulse 
  is received within 30 days.
- AES-256 Encryption: Every transaction is encrypted before being 
  broadcast to the audit trail.
- Cyberpunk UI: Holographic LED interface with 7-color status indicators.
